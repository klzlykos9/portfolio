You are a senior frontend UI/UX engineer.

Replit indicated the attempted full redesign is too large in scope, so I want you to make *targeted improvements* to enhance the homepage layout, theme, visuals, and navigation previews — without rewriting the entire site structure.

**Your task is to:**
1. Improve the homepage layout so content is not clipped, especially on laptops.
2. Add a **scrollable preview image panel** below the hero section with larger visuals that link to sections.
3. Change the theme to a **light, colorful, modern aesthetics** with subtle anime accents (One Piece, Naruto, Dragon Ball Z).
4. Improve fonts so text is readable and not cut off across screens.
5. Add smooth scroll navigation and micro-animations.

**Details:**

----------------------------------------
A) LAYOUT + FONT IMPROVEMENTS
----------------------------------------

- Ensure the homepage does not appear too zoomed in — especially large headings.
- Adjust CSS, margins, and viewport settings so all key text is visible without zooming manually.
- Update font sizes for:
  • Desktop
  • Laptops
  • Tablets
  • Mobiles
- Improve spacing so nothing clips or overlaps.

----------------------------------------
B) THEME + COLORS
----------------------------------------

- Replace the current simple blue theme with a **light, vibrant, modern palette**:  
  • Soft pastel backgrounds  
  • Gentle gradients  
  • Accent colors inspired by anime energy (gold, orange, cyan, violet)  
- Add subtle anime stylistic elements:
  • Small, low-opacity background graphics/icons (e.g., silhouette outlines like Luffy’s straw hat, Naruto’s swirl, DBZ energy lines) placed tastefully — not overwhelming.
  • Keep it artistic, clean, and modern.

----------------------------------------
C) PREVIEW IMAGE PANEL
----------------------------------------

Below the hero section, add a **scrollable panel** (carousel or row) with *larger preview cards* (not tiny icons) for:
- About
- Skills
- Certifications
- Internships
- Experience
- Projects
- Blog
- Contact

Each card should contain:
• A representative image/illustrative preview  
• Section title  
• Smooth hover animation  
• Clickable scroll to the respective section

Animations:
- Fade-in on scroll
- Slide-in from edges
- Slight zoom on hover for preview cards

On mobile:
- Horizontal scroll with swipe interaction

----------------------------------------
D) SMOOTH SCROLL + MOTION UI
----------------------------------------

- Add smooth scrolling for navigation
- Add subtle micro-interactions:
  • Button hover effects
  • Section fade-ins
  • Slide-in headers

Use CSS or JS scroll behavior enhancements.

----------------------------------------
E) RESPONSIVE CHECK
----------------------------------------

- Ensure all changes render well on:
  • Desktop
  • Laptop
  • Tablet
  • Mobile
- No clipping of text or hidden elements
- Preview cards should resize fluidly

----------------------------------------
OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
----------------------------------------

1. Modified homepage code with updated layout & theme
2. CSS or JS implementing color palette and animations
3. Updated preview image panel below hero section
4. Scroll navigation between sections
5. Confirmation that fonts are readable and not clipped
6. Confirmation of anime visual touches in theme

----------------------------------------
FINAL GOAL
----------------------------------------

• A more visually attractive, modern homepage  
• Light, colorful anime-inspired theme  
• Larger preview navigation instead of tiny icons  
• Smooth interactions and swipe-friendly layout  
• Better typography and spacing on all devices
