You are a senior frontend UI/UX engineer and creative web designer.

I want to significantly redesign the homepage of my portfolio to be **bigger, more dynamic, more visually engaging, and modern** — blending AI/finance aesthetic with artistic anime elements.

Follow these detailed instructions:

----------------------------------------
1) HOMEPAGE STRUCTURE & INTERACTIVITY
----------------------------------------

Create a **longer, scrollable homepage** with visible section shortcuts that scroll down into the content — not just a single square page.

Below the hero section, add a **vertically scrollable navigation panel** (or carousel) with **bigger section previews**.

Each preview card must include:
• A large image or graphic representing the section (not just icons)
• Section title
• Short caption
• Clickable area that smoothly scrolls to that section

Sections to preview:
• About
• Skills
• Certifications
• Internships
• Experience
• Projects
• Blog
• Contact

The preview area must be large, retina-friendly, and animated.

----------------------------------------
2) THEMING, COLORS & STYLE
----------------------------------------

Replace the current blue color scheme. Design a **light, colorful, artistic theme** with:
• Soft gradients
• Subtle neon accents (AI / futuristic vibe)
• Warm pastel tones and modern light palettes
• Background geometric shapes or pattern overlays

Make the visual style **2025+ appropriate**:
• Bold typography
• Expressive color combinations
• Subtle 3D effects
• Motion and hover states for engagement

Incorporate **anime touches** (tasteful, not overdone) such as:
• Small character illustrations or lightweight silhouettes (e.g., stylized references to One Piece characters like Luffy, Shanks, or Naruto theme colors) on section cards or background elements — balanced so it enhances UX not distracts. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

----------------------------------------
3) ANIMATION EFFECTS
----------------------------------------

Add modern animations and motion UI elements:
• Slide-in cards from left/right as they enter the viewport
• Fade-in text
• Swipe effects for horizontal scroll areas
• Parallax background sections
• Micro-interactions (hover animations, button ripples)
• Smooth scroll between sections

Use best practices from current animation design inspiration (such as micro-animations, parallax, kinetic typography effects). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

----------------------------------------
4) RESPONSIVE & TYPOGRAPHY TUNING
----------------------------------------

Improve typography so the page never crops content:
• Responsive fluid font sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
• Better line height and letter spacing
• Avoid text clipping at all viewports

Make sure the design is mobile-first and responsive:
• Preview carousel becomes horizontal scroll on mobile
• Animations degrade gracefully on low-power devices

----------------------------------------
5) SECTION CONTENT & NAVIGATION
----------------------------------------

Each section must be:
• Anchored with IDs (#about, #skills, etc.)
• Visually distinct (color bands, graphics, animated shapes)
• Easy to scroll to with smooth scroll

Add a “Back to Top” floating button that appears after scroll.

----------------------------------------
6) AI AGENT (Nami) UI REFRESH
----------------------------------------

Keep Nami hologram at a fixed bottom corner, but:
• Update the button/animation to cooperate with the new homepage theme
• Add subtle hover glow and parallax shadow
• Use a soft animated “breathing” animation when idle

Ensure Nami is integrated without blocking content.

----------------------------------------
OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
----------------------------------------

Provide:
1) Updated homepage layout code
2) CSS/JS animations
3) New preview section cards with images
4) Smooth scroll logic
5) Responsive breakpoints
6) Confirmation that all navigation links scroll to correct sections
7) Screenshots or staged previews of what was added

----------------------------------------
FINAL GOAL
----------------------------------------

• A bigger, scrollable interactive homepage  
• Visually rich section previews  
• Light, modern, colorful anime-friendly AI theme  
• Modern animation and micro-interactions  
• Fully responsive and mobile-friendly
