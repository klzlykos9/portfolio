You are a senior frontend engineer and AI product engineer.

I am working on my portfolio website and AI assistant "Nami". I need you to fix two things:

1) Fix a font layout issue on the home page.
2) Train and configure Nami using my portfolio data so she behaves like a real portfolio manager.

-------------------------------------
TASK 1 — HOME PAGE FONT FIX
-------------------------------------

Problem:
The main hero font on the home page is too large. The top portion of the text is getting cut off and users must zoom out to see it properly.

Your task:
- Identify the home page hero text component
- Reduce the font size slightly so the full text is always visible
- Fix any line-height or overflow issues
- Ensure no text gets hidden or clipped

STRICT RULES:
- Do NOT change layout
- Do NOT change spacing structure
- Do NOT change colors
- Do NOT change animations
- Do NOT change content or wording
- Only fix font sizing and overflow issues

Goal:
The homepage text should be fully visible on all screen sizes without zooming.

-------------------------------------
TASK 2 — TRAIN NAMI USING PORTFOLIO DATA
-------------------------------------

I want Nami to behave like my professional portfolio manager.

Your task:
1. Extract all portfolio information from my website including:
   - Projects
   - Blogs
   - Experience
   - Journey
   - Skills
   - About section

2. Convert this information into a structured knowledge base for Nami.

3. Inject this data directly into Nami’s system prompt so she can answer instantly without searching.

-------------------------------------
NAMI BEHAVIOR RULES
-------------------------------------

Nami must behave like a portfolio manager, not a chatbot.

She must:
- Explain my projects clearly
- Describe technologies used
- Talk about my journey and experience
- Guide visitors through the portfolio

She must NOT:
- Spam users
- Repeatedly ask for name/email
- Push for contact info
- Ask unnecessary questions

She should:
- Be friendly
- Be professional
- Use light humor when appropriate
- Keep conversation natural

Only ask for contact details IF user says:
- They want to hire
- They want to collaborate
- They want to connect
- They want to talk to Arpan

Then follow:
1) Ask if they want to leave a message
2) If yes, ask name + email or phone

-------------------------------------
PERFORMANCE RULES
-------------------------------------

- Do NOT use chat memory
- Do NOT store conversation history
- Do NOT use vector DB
- Do NOT use embeddings
- Use stateless inference
- Only last user message should be processed

This is to keep Nami fast and responsive.

-------------------------------------
STRICT RULES
-------------------------------------

- Do NOT redesign the website
- Do NOT refactor unrelated code
- Do NOT change animations
- Do NOT change page layout
- Do NOT change UI structure
- Only modify font sizing logic and AI logic

-------------------------------------
OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
-------------------------------------

1. Show which files were modified for font fix
2. Show the updated font styles
3. Show extracted portfolio data
4. Show Nami's new system prompt with embedded portfolio data
5. Confirm Nami responds using portfolio knowledge only
6. Confirm performance improvement

-------------------------------------
FINAL GOAL
-------------------------------------

- Homepage text must be fully visible without zoom
- Nami must answer instantly using portfolio data
- Nami must behave like a real portfolio manager
- No spam behavior
- No memory lag
