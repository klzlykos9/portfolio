You are a senior frontend engineer and AI product engineer.

I am working on my portfolio website and AI assistant "Nami". There are serious UX and stability issues that must be fixed properly.

Your task is to fix the homepage layout problems and stabilize Nami's AI behavior.

=====================================
TASK 1 — FIX HOMEPAGE ZOOM, FONT & LAYOUT
=====================================

Problems:
- The homepage appears too zoomed in.
- The hero text is too large and gets clipped at the top.
- Users must zoom out manually to see the full content.
- The layout does not adapt properly to different screen sizes.

Your responsibilities:

1. Fix the viewport scaling so the homepage is not overly zoomed.
2. Ensure proper meta viewport configuration.
3. Fix hero text font size so it never gets clipped.
4. Fix line-height, padding, and overflow issues.
5. Ensure text is fully visible on:
   - Desktop
   - Laptop
   - Tablet
   - Mobile
6. Make the homepage fully responsive using proper CSS breakpoints.
7. Ensure no content is hidden, cut off, or requires manual zooming.

STRICT RULES:
- Do NOT change text content
- Do NOT change colors
- Do NOT change animations
- Do NOT change layout structure
- Only fix zoom, font sizing, spacing, and responsiveness

GOAL:
Homepage must render at a normal zoom level and all text must be fully visible without zooming.

=====================================
TASK 2 — ADD SCROLL BUTTON
=====================================

Add a modern scroll-down button on the homepage.

Requirements:
- Position: bottom center or bottom right
- Smooth scroll to next section
- Minimal modern design
- Must match existing theme
- Must not break layout or animations

=====================================
TASK 3 — STABILIZE NAMI AI AGENT
=====================================

Problem:
Nami is crashing due to memory usage and chat history storage.

Your responsibilities:

1. Remove all memory, storage, and history features:
   - No chat history
   - No session memory
   - No vector database
   - No embeddings
   - No persistent storage
   - No localStorage
   - No cookies

2. Implement stateless AI inference:
   - Only last user message is processed
   - No previous context
   - No memory retention

3. Train Nami using only portfolio data:
   - Extract projects
   - Extract blogs
   - Extract experience
   - Extract journey
   - Extract skills
   - Inject this data directly into system prompt

4. Make Nami behave like a portfolio manager:
   - Explain projects
   - Explain technologies
   - Explain journey
   - Guide visitors
   - No spam behavior
   - No repeated questions
   - No pushing for contact info

5. Nami must NEVER store:
   - Names
   - Emails
   - Phone numbers
   - Messages
   - Any user data

She only replies.

=====================================
PERFORMANCE RULES
=====================================

- Stateless inference only
- No memory
- No database
- No session storage
- No caching chat
- No background processes

=====================================
STRICT RULES
=====================================

- Do NOT redesign UI
- Do NOT change animations
- Do NOT change portfolio content
- Do NOT refactor unrelated code
- Do NOT touch backend unless required for AI

Only modify homepage layout logic and AI agent logic.

=====================================
OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
=====================================

1. Show files modified for homepage zoom and font fix
2. Show updated viewport and responsive CSS
3. Show scroll button implementation
4. Show Nami system prompt with embedded portfolio data
5. Show stateless AI inference logic
6. Confirm crash issue is fixed
7. Confirm homepage renders correctly on all screen sizes

=====================================
FINAL GOAL
=====================================

- Homepage must render at normal zoom level
- Homepage text must be readable without zoom
- Homepage must be responsive on all screens
- Scroll button must work smoothly
- Nami must be fast and stable
- No memory crashes
- Nami replies only about portfolio
