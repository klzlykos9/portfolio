Strict Rules: - Do NOT modify any text content - Do NOT change layout, UI, colors, fonts, spacing, or branding - Do NOT touch portfolio sections or personal data - Only remove the dragon animation logic, assets, shaders, canvas, Three.js, Lottie, or JS animation - Ensure site remains visually identical except the dragon is gone Now after removing the dragon, implement a custom AI portfolio assistant.
